Use Git\nIf you don't know what Git is, it's an amazing tool that allows you to save your project at various states and roll back to those states if something goes wrong. If you're a newbie, it's probably easier to get started with a GUI interface like [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), or [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).\n# 2. Use Google\nDon't feel guilty searching up things you don't know! You don't have to stick to official documentation either: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), Youtube and other forums or websites are great places to be.\n# 3. Use Open Source Packages\nIf you're developing a web or desktop application, this is even more important. When I started programming I too was obsessed with making everything from the ground up with only official features, but that's like reinventing the wheel. These amazing packages have been developed, so why not use them?"},"__N_SSG":true}
