## An Intro To Sorting
### Sorting Algorithms
An algorithm if a fancy way of saying "a way of doing something": thus, a sorting algorithm is a way of putting objects in sorted order. Common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, heap sort, and quick sort.
### Time Complexity
Time complexity gives us a rough sense of how fast or efficient a certain algorithm is, by counting how many comparisons it makes. Any constant values involved in the calculation are ignored. For example, if the algorithm makes n<sup>2</sup>/2 comparisons, we say its time complexity is n<sup>2</sup>.
